Hello and welcome to the June 2022 edition of the monthly report!

## mCaptcha is incorporated!

I spent June doing non-technical tasks but I made significant
progress: I had been trying to do it since summer 2021, but I faced
various setbacks along the way. A family friend, who is also an auditor
helped me finally get mCaptcha incorporated!

And we've already filed successfully filed the first tax return too!

## Ideas for Commercial Operations

Commercial operations will take a while longer(end of 2022, most
probably). For [Hostea](https://hostea.org), I wrote a dashboard with
payments capabilities(via Stripe) so that experience will help me do the
same for mCaptcha. Working on Hostea has been truly enlightening: it's
probably the first effort to offer a fully libre, infrastructure-as-code
and payments software included, hosting service. I would like to do the
same for mCaptcha so that service that I setup goes rogue or if someone
wants to offer mCaptcha hosted services, they can replicate my set up
with ease.

But the commercial offering will at no point force me or future
maintainers turn mCaptcha into adopting a non-free license like the
[Server Side Public
License](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license).
So the following months will see administrative changes within mCaptcha
to device mechanisms to prevent me or any future party with influence in
mCaptcha development from hurting the project by it non-free.

Hostea is also an experiment in Free Software commercial operations, so
naturally I'm highly impressed by the ideas that are being discussed
there. mCaptcha, too, will borrow ideas from that project to make its
development economically sustainable.
