Difficulty factor determines the time it takes to solve a CAPTCHA. The
higher the difficulty factor, the longer it will take to generate a
proof of work for it to solve the CAPTCHA.

mCaptcha's proof of work based mechanism makes it highly accessible to
people with special needs but it is important to choose the difficulty factor
with care as very high difficulty factors will make the CAPTCHA
inaccessible to users on slow devices.
